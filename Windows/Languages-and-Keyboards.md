# See the Existing Installed Languages & Keyboards
Either use the built-in PowerShell cmdlet. It might show only some of the keyboards.
```PowerShell
Get-WinUserLanguageList
```
Or use the Registry key/value
```PowerShell
Get-ItemProperty -Path "REGISTRY::HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Keyboard Layout\Preload"
# And
Get-ItemProperty -Path "REGISTRY::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\.DEFAULT\Keyboard Layout\Preload"
```
Or check the list from the `Settings` menu.
```
Settings --> Time & Languages --> Language & Region
```

# Fix issues with Windows Languages & Keyboard Layouts
## Remove Unwanted Languages (e.g., British English - UK Language)
Windows is stupid and, for unknown reasons (at least to me), add some languages you didn't ask for. Unsurprisingly, you can't remove them as you have not added them. ðŸ™„

You could take these steps to fix it.

### Option 1: PowerShell Built-in Cmdlet
The following command will add the US keyboard and language to the list. It seems stupid, but it will fix the issue. ðŸ˜†
```PowerShell
$US_Language = New-WinUserLanguageList en-US
Set-WinUserLanguageList $US_Language
```

### Option 2: Windows Settings
1. Go to the Languages and Keyboards settings. You can follow these steps in Windows 11 to see the list of all installed languages and keyboard layouts.
```
Settings --> Time & Languages --> Language & Region
```
2. Add all the languages and/or keyboards you see in the language bar (`Win + Space`) but do not see in the settings (previous step).<br>

  ðŸ”¸Uncheck all the features in the pop window.<br>
  ðŸ”¸Add all `languages` and `keyboards` (from _Language Options_).
3. Remove unwanted languages and/or keyboards from the settings.

### Option 3: Registry Keys
I suggest you get a backup before you make any changes to registry keys.
```PowerShell
Remove-ItemProperty -Path "REGISTRY::HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Keyboard Layout\Preload" -Name *
# And
Remove-ItemProperty -Path "REGISTRY::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\.DEFAULT\Keyboard Layout\Preload" -Name *
```
